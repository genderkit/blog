Anything that’s on record can be requested, so long as it’s not subject to one of the defined exemptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the trans community, a lot of activists use FOI requests to get information on the various waiting times involved in trans healthcare. This is a great way not only to highlight problems, but to help people make informed decisions about their healthcare, particularly around whether to spend large amounts of money on private services. 
However, there are a number of common mistakes and pitfalls people often make in their FOI requests that can make the information gained less useful both to the requester and to others. Sometimes FOI requests are overused or misused, such as by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repeating work&lt;/strong&gt; that someone has already done&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sending FOIs to clinics who &lt;strong&gt;already publish&lt;/strong&gt; this information in a useable format, or are happy to answer the questions informally via email&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Asking for data that is &lt;strong&gt;not useful&lt;/strong&gt; or meaningfully comparable, or&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wording questions poorly&lt;/strong&gt; in a way that allows clinics to give &lt;strong&gt;misleading&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;incomplete&lt;/strong&gt; answers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we will look at some basic principles and rules of thumb you can use to get better use of FOI requests in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Gender Construction Kit, we’ve been providing the community with information about UK gender services, relating to &lt;a href=&quot;https://genderkit.org.uk/resources/gender-services/&quot;&gt;referral criteria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://genderkit.org.uk/resources/wait-times/&quot;&gt;wait lists&lt;/a&gt;, for some time now. We always try to ask for data in a &lt;em&gt;specific format&lt;/em&gt; via a &lt;em&gt;publicly-accountable&lt;/em&gt; forum. Not only does this ensure that the different figures we collect are meaningfully comparable to one another, but it also means we can make it easier for others to pick up where we leave off, and ensures that data collected by different groups is still easy to compare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following are general principles we’ve developed to try to achieve this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask for information to be put on the service’s website before making a request.&lt;/strong&gt; If the information is on the clinic’s website, it is more likely to be seen by people who need to know the information. Ask for this via email before submitting a formal FOI request.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work out who to send your request to.&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Questions about specific clinics will go to the NHS Trust or Health Board it exists under.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Questions about national policies and protocols will usually go to one of NHS England, NHS Scotland, NHS Wales or HSC Northern Ireland, or occasionally to one of the national-scale Public Health organisations.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Questions about local prescribing policies will go to the Clinical Commissioning Group or Health Board for that area.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make your request through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/&quot;&gt;WhatDoTheyKnow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; If the response is publicly available, it can be used by other people in future looking at changes over time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check whether the information has already been requested on WDTK recently.&lt;/strong&gt; Time spent by clinicians responding to these requests reduces the time clinicians could be seeing patients in.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check whether historical data already exists.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re asking for data about past years, it is likely someone has already asked for it. A bit of Googling, asking around, or checking on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/&quot;&gt;WhatDoTheyKnow&lt;/a&gt; archive could turn something useful up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use a consistent title so requests can be easily searched for.&lt;/strong&gt; “Gender services - [Clinic name] - [Request type]” works well. This allows people to easily find all requests of this type if they are compiling information comparing different clinics.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Try to stick to the name the clinic uses for itself officially, rather than any past names or nicknames it might have. If you’re asking about the youth branch of a service that caters to both adults and young people, include the word “Youth”. Being consistent about names makes it easier for others to find your data.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If there are multiple possible names, try to use the same one that other people have been using in their own FOI requests.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask for data for a particular financial year or quarter.&lt;/strong&gt; This makes it easier to compare data across multiple requests, as most information available is broken down by financial year, quarter, or month. For example, ask for “in FY 2020/2021 Q4” or “between 1st Jan to 31st Mar 2021 inclusive”. If asking for information as of a specific date, use the last day of that time period (for example “as of the end of FY 2020/2021” or “as of 31st Mar 2021”).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on exactly what you’re asking for, there are other things you should think about…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jump to:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#waiting-times&quot;&gt;Waiting times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#transfers-between-services&quot;&gt;Transfers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#clinic-throughput&quot;&gt;Throughput&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#funding&quot;&gt;Funding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;waiting-times&quot;&gt;Waiting times&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of different figures for waiting times can be found floating around the internet. Inconsistencies between these waiting times can generally be put down to inconsistencies in exactly what was asked for, or questions that have multiple possible answers where different clinics have interpreted it differently.
To avoid this, you can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specify what type of average you want.&lt;/strong&gt; There are a number of different types of “average”, such as mean, median and mode. Normally the most useful number will be the mean, like “average (mean) time in weeks from referral to first appointment”. If one service uses a different type of average to others, they can’t be compared.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask for a particular date range.&lt;/strong&gt; Ask for people seen for an appointment at a particular time, like “patients seen between 1st Jan to 31st Mar 2021 inclusive”. If you don’t do this, some services will just say that information is already available on their website or in another request, even if that information is out of date. It’s also useful when comparing clinics to know if the data corresponds to the same time frame.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specify that you’re asking about actual treatment or assessment appointments.&lt;/strong&gt; Some clinics offer “informational” appointments solely to give information to future patients. If no treatment or assessment takes place in this appointment, including it can lead to misleadingly low wait figures.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask about initial appointments separately to follow-up appointments.&lt;/strong&gt; Services may still be seeing patients for follow-up appointments, but have stopped providing initial appointments.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask for priority cases to be excluded from the average.&lt;/strong&gt; Some services will prioritise some patients (for example, because they have already received a private diagnosis, asked for a referral from the GP years previously but were never referred properly, or are experiencing extreme distress). These cases don’t reflect how long people will normally wait and could result in misleading information.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask for transfers to be excluded from the average.&lt;/strong&gt; Services may expect some patients to wait for less time if they have already waited elsewhere, most often for patients who have previously been seen by a youth service, but sometimes for other adult services. Including these patients in the average could make wait times look much shorter than they actually are.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider asking for minimum, maximum, IQR (interquartile range) to identify issues.&lt;/strong&gt; This information will make it clearer whether there is a subset of patients who are having to wait for significantly longer or shorter times.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider asking how long it takes for patients to be approved for certain key treatments.&lt;/strong&gt; Waiting times for a first appointment aren’t always the best measure of how long it will take to receive hormones or surgery, as different clinics may have different processes.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask for the wait since the previous stage in the process,&lt;/strong&gt; rather than from initial referral. Wait from initial referral will include the initial wait time as it was for patients some time in the past, which is likely no longer an accurate representation of current waits.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask for the minimum time to be approved.&lt;/strong&gt; Gender clinics see a variety of different people, not just people who will immediately want hormones and then surgery; asking for the minimum required time will produce more useful results.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask in terms of number of appointments.&lt;/strong&gt; Clinics will generally hold this information in terms of number of appointments, rather than as time on the calendar; requests for this information in terms of time will likely be rejected for exceeding the maximum cost.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask for the average wait between appointments.&lt;/strong&gt; Combined with the minimum number of appointments before approval, this will give an approximate time frame.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Please provide:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the average (mean) time in weeks from referral to first treatment or assessment appointment for patients whose first such appointment happened last quarter (between 1st Jan to 31st Mar 2021 inclusive), excluding patients who have waited for a shorter time due to a wait at another clinic&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the minimum number of appointments a patient must attend at this clinic before being approved for hormone treatment, assuming that the patient has not transferred from another clinic&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the average (mean) time in weeks between treatment or assessment appointments for patients who received a follow-up appointment last quarter (between 1st Jan to 31st Mar 2021 inclusive)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When publishing the information you’ve collected, make sure to make it clear exactly what questions you asked, either with the data itself or by linking to the request on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/&quot;&gt;WhatDoTheyKnow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;transfers-between-services&quot;&gt;Transfers between services&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some clinics will prioritise patients differently if they were previously being treated by, or on the waiting list for, another clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to get information about this, make sure to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask separately about the different situations people could transfer service in.&lt;/strong&gt; A new patient may have transferred from a youth to an adult service, another service in the same nation (e.g. from one NHS England service to another), or from a service in one nation to another nation (e.g. from an NHS Scotland service to an NHS England one). Many services have different rules for each situation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask about patients who have not yet been seen from the service they are transferring from.&lt;/strong&gt; Many services have different rules for this situation than if a patient is already part of an active patient load.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask about whether transfers are accepted in each situation.&lt;/strong&gt; Some clinics will not accept a transfer of care in specific situations. Knowing this in advance can help avoid unnecessary waits for treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask about whether people will be seen more quickly if they have already waited elsewhere.&lt;/strong&gt; This can help people who are moving (e.g. from Northern Ireland to England) decide which service they should ask to be referred to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For each of:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;patients previously referred to a youth gender service (e.g. GIDS)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;patients previously referred to another adult gender service&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;patients previously referred to an adult gender service in a different UK nation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;please indicate whether:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;patients referred to you, who have previously been added to another wait list but had not yet been seen, would have this previous wait taken into account in their position in the queue for your service&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;patients referred to you, who had been seen for a first appointment for the previous service, would have this previous wait taken into account in their position in the queue for your service&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;clinic-throughput&quot;&gt;Clinic throughput&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as asking about waiting times, you might also want to ask broader questions about “throughput”, i.e. how many people are at various stages of the process in a given time frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask for both numbers of referrals received and referrals accepted.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all requests received by a service will be accepted (for example, if a GP does not provide adequate information in the referral or refers someone outside of the correct age range for the service)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask for both first appointments carried out, and follow-up appointments carried out.&lt;/strong&gt; Some services will focus primarily on seeing their existing patient load, giving a misleading impression of how fast a wait list is being processed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask about the number of patients on the waiting list and active patient list as of  the end of that time period.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For the period 1st April 2020 to 31st March 2021, please provide the number of:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;referrals received&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;referrals accepted&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;first appointments carried out&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;follow-up appointments carried out&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;discharges from the service&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Please provide the number of patients who, as of 31st March 2021, are:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;currently on the wait list for the service&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;currently an active patient at the service&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;funding&quot;&gt;Funding&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asking questions about funding will be a little different from asking questions about waiting times. This information is much less subject to change, and is typically set at either a national or local level, rather than per gender clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will need to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work out which body will hold the information you need.&lt;/strong&gt; Funding is typically not decided by a specific gender clinic, but instead by the national health service (e.g. NHS Scotland or HSC NI), or by the health authority local for the patient (e.g. a CCG in England or a Health Board in Wales). This can mean that people attending the same gender service from different parts of the country might have different funding situations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check treatment protocols for this information.&lt;/strong&gt; Often funding information is specified in protocols or service specifications published by the relevant body. Even if you can’t find exactly the information you’re looking for, reading through these documents might give you a better idea of how to frame your question.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specify the treatment carefully.&lt;/strong&gt; This is especially important for treatments like hair removal, where facial hair removal is likely to be treated differently to hair removal required as preparation for surgery.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specify whether you’re asking just for patients attending a gender service, or any patient.&lt;/strong&gt; Often there will be a generic aesthetic referral funding process that differs from the process for patients of a gender service.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask what is required for funding.&lt;/strong&gt; NHS funding is often dependent on the patient meeting certain prerequisites. For example, funding may only be available to people with a formal diagnosis, people on hormones, or people with a particular gender identity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask how much funding is available.&lt;/strong&gt; Some treatments, such as facial hair removal, are typically funded from a limited budget per patient, or for only a limited number of sessions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Please provide:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The list of prerequisites that must be met before a patient receiving treatment from a specialist gender service may receive funding for facial hair removal.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In such cases, how much funding is available.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully by now you’ll have a better idea of how to go about making Freedom of Information requests. In general, we want to avoid reinventing the work or duplicating effort, so keep your ear to the ground and talk to other people about what they’re doing. Keep in mind how you expect the data to be used, as this should inform exactly what sorts of questions you’ll need to ask. Ask yourself: are you mainly asking for activists or patients? What do UK trans people need to know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, we want to work towards a situation where we hardly need to make FOI requests at all. Requesting the same data from clinics every few months is unglamorous, tiresome, and generally unsustainable. Luckily, many clinics are moving towards making more and more of their information publicly available; a good example of this is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.leedsandyorkpft.nhs.uk/our-services/gender-identity-service/&quot;&gt;Leeds Gender Identity Service&lt;/a&gt;, who have published detailed information about the waits for each stage of their process on their website. Having a better dialogue with the more cooperative clinics is key here, as they can give us more insight into the right questions to ask. What’s more, the more information that these more cooperative clinics put out there, the more pressure there will be on other clinics to follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any comments on FOI requests, or anything we’ve not covered that you think is worth mentioning, please don’t hesitate to get in touch. We’ll aim to update this article every so often based on our own experiences as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Freedom of Information (FOI) requests are a good way for activists and organisers to get information from public bodies (like government departments or NHS bodies).

&lt;p&gt;During the coronavirus pandemic, many of the in-person support groups for UK trans, non-binary, and gender nonconforming people have moved to online platforms like Zoom. If you’ve not been able to go to a local support group - maybe because you don’t have a local group, or haven’t been able to attend it - it’s a great time to try joining in from the comfort of your own home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We contacted groups from across the UK, and many are really keen for people from outside of their local areas to join in. Each group has a unique community - why not try some of these and see which suits you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gendered-intelligence&quot;&gt;Gendered Intelligence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/gi-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Gendered Intelligence logo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The many youth groups run by Gendered Intelligence have moved online due to the coronavirus pandemic. They told us:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We have people from across the UK joining our groups now. We are aiming to return service in-person from June onwards, but are looking to keep some online services running for exactly this reason that we’re now providing a service for people outside our local groups.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different groups cater for different age ranges, with some available to people as young as 11, while others are for people up to 20 or even older.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the groups on &lt;a href=&quot;http://genderedintelligence.co.uk/support/trans-youth/groups&quot;&gt;the Gendered Intelligence website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spectra-london&quot;&gt;Spectra London&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spectra London’s transgender and non-binary social groups are still running online due to the pandemic, and accept people from across the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“When we took the groups online, we realised that there was a huge need across the UK for social groups as there is a lack of support due to groups either closing due to Covid19, or just a lack of support in rural areas… we recently updated our accessibility support so can now offer subtitles and audio description as needed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hastings &amp;amp; Rother Rainbow Alliance’s Trans Support Group meet on the second and last Wednesdays of the month on Zoom from 19pm to 21pm and are happy to welcome people attending from outside of the local area. To get access, email hrrat@hrra.org.uk - and you can find out more on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hrra.org.uk/trans/trans-group/&quot;&gt;the HRRA website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/transforum-logo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;TransForum Manchester logo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unique together with TransForum are running two Support groups - Unique Transgender Network North Wales (Every Thursday evening 8-11pm) and TransForum Manchester (Every Saturday afternoon from 3.30-7.00 pm) as Zoom on-line meetings.  These are open to anyone who is over 18 and is gender diverse, a family member or supporting a Trans person in all our groups. People have been attending from the rest of the UK outside of Wales, and even from outside of the UK. They are intending to incorporate Zoom in physical meetings when they are resumed.&lt;/p&gt;

In &lt;strong&gt;Cambridgeshire&lt;/strong&gt; only, you can joing in with online events run by &lt;a href=&quot;http://encompassnetwork.org.uk/online-community-support-for-the-covid-19-quarantine/&quot;&gt;Encompass Network&lt;/a&gt;, and if you like in &lt;strong&gt;Nottingham&lt;/strong&gt; you can join &lt;a href=&quot;https://tsnnotts.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Trans Space Notts&lt;/a&gt; online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is your group operating online and you’d like people to join you from elsewhere in the country? Let us know by getting in touch on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/genderkit&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/genderkit&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Photo by Chris Montgomery on Unsplash During the coronavirus pandemic, many of the in-person support groups for UK trans, non-binary, and gender nonconforming people have moved to online platforms like Zoom. If you’ve not been able to go to a local support group - maybe because you don’t have a local group, or haven’t been able to attend it - it’s a great time to try joining in from the comfort of your own home. We contacted groups from across the UK, and many are really keen for people from outside of their local areas to join in. Each group has a unique community - why not try some of these and see which suits you? Gendered Intelligence The many youth groups run by Gendered Intelligence have moved online due to the coronavirus pandemic. They told us: “We have people from across the UK joining our groups now. We are aiming to return service in-person from June onwards, but are looking to keep some online services running for exactly this reason that we’re now providing a service for people outside our local groups.” Different groups cater for different age ranges, with some available to people as young as 11, while others are for people up to 20 or even older. You can find out more about the groups on the Gendered Intelligence website. Spectra London Spectra London’s transgender and non-binary social groups are still running online due to the pandemic, and accept people from across the UK. “When we took the groups online, we realised that there was a huge need across the UK for social groups as there is a lack of support due to groups either closing due to Covid19, or just a lack of support in rural areas… we recently updated our accessibility support so can now offer subtitles and audio description as needed.” You can find out more about the groups on the Spectra London website. Hastings &amp;amp; Rother Rainbow Alliance Hastings &amp;amp; Rother Rainbow Alliance’s Trans Support Group meet on the second and last Wednesdays of the month on Zoom from 19pm to 21pm and are happy to welcome people attending from outside of the local area. To get access, email hrrat@hrra.org.uk - and you can find out more on the HRRA website. Unique Transgender Network and TransForum Manchester Unique together with TransForum are running two Support groups - Unique Transgender Network North Wales (Every Thursday evening 8-11pm) and TransForum Manchester (Every Saturday afternoon from 3.30-7.00 pm) as Zoom on-line meetings. These are open to anyone who is over 18 and is gender diverse, a family member or supporting a Trans person in all our groups. People have been attending from the rest of the UK outside of Wales, and even from outside of the UK. They are intending to incorporate Zoom in physical meetings when they are resumed. “To all TransForum Manchester and Unique North Wales members, allies and friends and all Gender Diverse people. Unique and TransForum have decided to combine their Zoom meetings, which are open to everyone, not just existing members of these groups. Meetings will continue on Thursday evenings between 8.00 pm (19.00 GMT) and 11.00 pm (22.00 GMT), and on Saturday afternoons between 3.30 pm (14.30 GMT) and 7.00 pm (18.00 GMT).

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;http://genderkit.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Gender Construction Kit&lt;/a&gt;, we help trans, nonbinary, and other gender non-conforming people work out how to change things linked to gender. A question we see a lot of people ask is: &lt;em&gt;how do I grow my hair long?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For people who’ve had short hair all their lives, it can be a real surprise how complex it is to look after longer hair. There’s a huge variety of information out there about hair care, and it’s difficult to know who to trust. Luckily, we’ve been reading through the dermatology and cosmetic science textbooks and journals for you so you don’t have to. Read on to find out what you need to do if you’re growing your hair out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-basics&quot;&gt;The basics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2LnGjhQ0Z0bW8GM8y9eC4Q.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;A paddle style hairbrush on a table&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When hair is grown longer it stays attached to your head accumulating damage, perhaps for up to several years, so you need to work harder to protect it than you would with shorter hair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s some simple rules you need to follow in order to keep your hair looking good:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;wash your hair &lt;strong&gt;regularly but not too often&lt;/strong&gt; (twice a week works well for many people)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;when you wash hair with shampoo, &lt;strong&gt;always use a conditioner&lt;/strong&gt; afterwards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;always &lt;strong&gt;wait for your hair to dry&lt;/strong&gt; before detangling, brushing, combing, straightening or curling it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dry your hair carefully&lt;/strong&gt;, ideally patting it dry rather than rubbing it with a towel&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;always &lt;strong&gt;rinse your hair after swimming&lt;/strong&gt; in a pool or the sea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be wondering — do I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; need to do all this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-sciencebit&quot;&gt;The science bit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*YysBiSf0poRI98Vz&quot; alt=&quot;Macro shot of ombre blond and brown hair&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hair is covered in a protective layer of scales called the &lt;strong&gt;cuticle&lt;/strong&gt;. This protects the more delicate inner layers of the hair. If the scales are undamaged and smoothly layered, the hair will look glossy and smooth. If the cuticle gets damaged — which can happen for all sorts of reasons — the delicate inside parts of the hair start to unravel, leading to split ends, and eventually the hair breaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s bad — damaged hair looks nasty, split ends make your hair look frizzy, and an increased rate of hair breakage slows the rate at which your hair gets longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you follow rules above, you can reduce how much the cuticle gets damaged. This means your hair looks good, and keeps growing well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-does-itwork&quot;&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists studying hair — &lt;em&gt;trichologists&lt;/em&gt; — have a name for damage to the cuticle: &lt;em&gt;hair weathering&lt;/em&gt;. Weathering has many different causes, including using heated straighteners and curlers, UV radiation, wind, humidity, sea salt, chlorinated water, dust, pollution, and friction. Luckily, most of these can be protected against.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;friction damage&lt;/strong&gt; — friction is caused during washing, brushing, and towel drying. Most conditioners contain chemicals called silicones which lubricate the hair shaft, reducing the amount of friction and the amount of damage caused by combing. Using conditioner significantly reduces the amount of damage done to the hair from combing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;chemical damage&lt;/strong&gt; — a number of chemicals can damage or remove the cuticle, particularly those used for bleaching, &lt;a href=&quot;https://genderkit.github.io/genderkit/article/hair-colouring/&quot;&gt;colouring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://genderkit.github.io/genderkit/article/permanent-hair-curling/&quot;&gt;permanently curling&lt;/a&gt; hair, so having these treatments as infrequently as possible will help to maintain the health of hair. Another source of chemical damage is chlorinated swimming pool water, so rinse your hair well after you leave the pool to minimise exposure.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;salt damage&lt;/strong&gt; — when hair dries, salt left in the hair dries into hard crystals which rub against the hair damaging it. It is important to rinse your hair after you have been swimming in sea water.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hair bubbling&lt;/strong&gt; — &lt;a href=&quot;https://genderkit.github.io/genderkit/article/hair-straightening/&quot;&gt;hair straightening&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://genderkit.github.io/genderkit/article/hair-curling/&quot;&gt;hair curling&lt;/a&gt; use very hot temperatures to change the shape of hair. If straighteners or curling tongs are applied to wet hair, the water absorbed by the hair rapidly boils and expands, producing cracks in the hair known as “bubbling” or “bubble hairs”. You can avoid this by not using straighteners or curling tongs on your hair until it has fully dried, and using heat protection products on your hair before heat styling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hair strand also can be damaged by other factors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;weakness from absorbing water&lt;/strong&gt; — hair becomes significantly more elastic when it is wet. Once your hair has absorbed water, much less force is required to stretch it to the point where it breaks. You should avoid trying to detangle your hair when it is wet — for example, after you have washed it, wait until it is dry before combing or brushing. If you have to detangle wet hair, use only your fingers or a wide-toothed comb to detangle it, and never a brush. You may also be able to reduce the amount of friction involved in drying by avoiding rubbing your hair with a towel and instead blotting/patting it or wrapping it in a towel.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;nutritional deficiency&lt;/strong&gt; — if you are not eating a balanced diet containing enough proteins, vitamins, minerals, and essential fatty acids, you can end up with a nutritional deficiency. Some deficiencies may cause hair to become dry and brittle, cause hair to thin, or cause alopecia (balding). Some hair products contain vitamins — these have little effect as you can’t absorb vitamins directly into your hair.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UV radiation&lt;/strong&gt; — when you are in sunlight, your hair is exposed to UV radiation from the sun which can damage your hair. Some hair products advertise UV protection, but often these aren’t helpful, as they either wash out of the hair or don’t coat it well. You can protect your hair by wearing a hat or bandana — or by staying out of the sun between 11am and 3pm in summer, which is recommended to protect your skin from UV radiation. Your hair is more susceptible to UV damage when it is wet, so try and keep it dry when you are out in the sun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of what you need to do will depend on exactly what your hair type is. The best thing you can do is find a hair stylist you can trust who can advise you. Seeing a hair stylist every few months allows them to trim the hair to remove damage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hair stylists generally recommend you do this even if you are growing your hair — if you allow split ends to happen, you may end up having to cut much more off to repair the damage. Your hair normally grows around 1cm a month (varying slightly from person to person based on your genetic background), which will give you an idea of how much you can trim off while keeping growing your hair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe people should be able to change things linked to gender — anything they need, to any mix they want, for as long as they like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks partly to the work of organisations like &lt;a href=&quot;https://transgirlscan.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;Trans Girls Can&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://genderedintelligence.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Gendered Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gires.org.uk/&quot;&gt;GIRES&lt;/a&gt; working with them, sports and fitness organisations, venues, and clubs have started to educate their staff and members in how they can help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So: what’s the current situation in 2018? And what do you need to know if you want to get into sport?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-bigsports&quot;&gt;The big sports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*wakoLjies77mhFe1&quot; alt=&quot;A football on the grass on a field&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the biggest sports organisations have now published at least &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; information on what clubs should do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Football:&lt;/strong&gt; the FA have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn0.genderedintelligence.co.uk/2016/09/13/09-50-06-transpeople-in-football-guide.pdf?&quot;&gt;Guide To Including Trans People in Football&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thefa.com/-/media/files/thefaportal/governance-docs/equality/lgbt/the-fa-policy-on-trans-people-in-football.ashx&quot;&gt;Policy on Trans People in Football&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tennis:&lt;/strong&gt; LTA British Tennis have published their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lta.org.uk/globalassets/about-lta/equality--diversity/lta-transgender-inclusion-policy.pdf&quot;&gt;Policy and guidance on trans people playing tennis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hockey:&lt;/strong&gt; England Hockey have produced a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.englandhockey.co.uk/core/core_picker/download.asp?id=16231&quot;&gt;Policy and Procedures for trans or transgender hockey players&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Netball:&lt;/strong&gt; England Netball also have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.englandnetball.co.uk/app/uploads/2016/03/Trans-Guidance-March-2017.docx&quot;&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Badminton:&lt;/strong&gt; Badminton England provide &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.badmintonengland.co.uk/media/5826/guidance_on_welcoming_transsexual_people_to_your_badminton_club_july_14.pdf&quot;&gt;Guidance for Badminton Clubs on welcoming transsexual players.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rugby:&lt;/strong&gt; RFU have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.englandrugby.com/mm/Document/MyRugby/Education/01/32/50/43/TransgenderTranssexual%28RugbySafeEssentialGuide%29May2017FINAL_Neutral.pdf&quot;&gt;Rugbysafe Essential Guide: Transgender, Transsexual and Gender Dysphoria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cricket:&lt;/strong&gt; the International Cricket Council now has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pulse-static-files.s3.amazonaws.com/ICC/document/2017/02/23/ec8dfc6e-0056-4572-997a-d83f91246047/ICC-Gender-Recognition-Policy-effective-from-20-February-2017.pdf&quot;&gt;Gender Recognition Policy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed a pattern here of England-specific guidelines, rather than UK-wide ones. There’s a few UK-wide policies on all sports that cover you, wherever you are in the country:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;students sports have the British Universities and Colleges Sport &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bucs.org.uk/core/core_picker/download.asp?id=31233&quot;&gt;Transgender Policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Sports Council Equality Group have published two guidelines which (unhelpfully) specifically refer to &lt;em&gt;transsexual people&lt;/em&gt; but may still be useful:  &lt;a href=&quot;http://equalityinsport.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Transexual-people-and-competitive-sport-guidance-for-national-governing-bodies-of-sport.pdf&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://equalityinsport.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Transsexual-People-Eligibility-to-Compete-in-Domestic-Competition.pdf&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and finally, there’s the old 2005 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lgbthistorymonth.org.uk/documents/DCMS%20Guidance%20-%20Transsexual%20People%20and%20Sport%20%281%29.pdf&quot;&gt;Guidance for sporting bodies&lt;/a&gt; published by the UK Goverment and UK Sport.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these aren’t everything in sports and fitness — if you’re intimidated by these sports, there are plenty of other options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;athletics&quot;&gt;Athletics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:4000/assets/images/UKA%20LOGO.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;UK Athletics logo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;United Kingdom Athletics have published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uka.org.uk/EasysiteWeb/getresource.axd?AssetID=146122&amp;amp;type=full&amp;amp;servicetype=Attachment&quot;&gt;Transgender Policy — Guidance for Athletics Clubs and Competition Providers&lt;/a&gt; that should be helpful to you if you’re interested in competing in athletics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;swimming&quot;&gt;Swimming&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/0_CaEWIZx8cPhgw-Bo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A person lane swimming in a pool, wearing a cap&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many swimming pools and gyms now have cubicle based changing rooms and showers which may be more comfortable for you. You may want to research your local fitness facilities to find out if there are any with these kinds of facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swimming can be particularly difficult for many people as it can involve very tight clothing that can make the shape of your chest or crotch visible. If you find your chest shape distresses you, most pools will be happy for you to wear a rash vest, which can help to hide your chest shape or conceal a &lt;a href=&quot;http://genderkit.org.uk/article/binding/&quot;&gt;binder&lt;/a&gt;. Many binders can be worn while swimming - check with your binder manufacturer to be sure. If your crotch causes you distress, you may be able to find “swim skirt” swimwear that hides your crotch shape, or wear loose “board shorts” style swimming trunks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some areas of the country there are organisations running regular sessions at swimming pools where transgender, nonbinary or gender variant people can attend as a group:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://transcansport.wordpress.com/trans-swimming-brighton/&quot;&gt;Trans Can Sport&lt;/a&gt; run sessions in Brighton&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/TransActive/&quot;&gt;Trans Active&lt;/a&gt; run sessions in Sheffield&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tagswim.co.uk&quot;&gt;TAGS&lt;/a&gt; run sessions in London&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re the more competitive sort, the good news is that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.swimwales.org/key-documents/84/download&quot;&gt;British Swimming&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.swimming.org/library/documents/222/download&quot;&gt;Swim England&lt;/a&gt; (what used to be the ASA) have published policies on trans competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;more-sports&quot;&gt;More sports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*QJCfUWQ-KCyXgxaT&quot; alt=&quot;A man rolling down the street in green rollerblades&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possibly the sport that’s most famous for its active LGBT+ inclusion, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ukrda.org.uk&quot;&gt;United Kingdom &lt;strong&gt;Roller Derby&lt;/strong&gt; Association&lt;/a&gt; has had a policy for supporting trans people since 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ice Hockey:&lt;/strong&gt; Ice Hockey UK have a comprehensive page on their website about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icehockeyuk.co.uk/transgender-policy/&quot;&gt;the inclusion of transgender people in ice hockey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cycling:&lt;/strong&gt; Cycling Time Trials UK have a brand new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cyclingtimetrials.org.uk/articles/view/302&quot;&gt;Transgender policy&lt;/a&gt; for 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rowing:&lt;/strong&gt; British Rowing have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britishrowing.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Transgender-Transexual-Policy-BR-2016.pdf&quot;&gt;a policy for transgender people&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;looking-for-something-a-bit-different&quot;&gt;Looking for something a bit different?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*c7j-UHLP0gQaX0Ny&quot; alt=&quot;The silhouette of a person riding a skateboard with orange wheels at sunset at University of Northern Iowa&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s loads of fun active pastimes you can get into if you think outside of the box of traditional sports. These activities are often place much less emphasis on segregation by gender, and so are often ideal for people with nonbinary or genderqueer identities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;skateboarding&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rock climbing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;martial arts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;circus skills&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;freerunning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rollerblading&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;watersports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re more of a supporter than a participant, there’s also the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tnbfsg&quot;&gt;Trans and Non-binary Football Supporters Group&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s 2018 and it’s impossible to avoid supporting trans, nonbinary, and other non-conforming students - we are everywhere!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might not be aware of it yet, but in the last few years, UK universities have been hard at work producing policies and guidance on how to best support their students - whatever their gender identity or history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read on to find out what your university has to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us know if there is a policy you know about that’s not on the list!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unis-arent-the-only-peopleinvolved&quot;&gt;Unis aren’t the only people involved&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s not just universities who are the only people who have a responsibility for their gender diverse student and staff bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:4000/assets/images/UKRI%20and%20nine%20council%20logos.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;UKRI and Research Council logos&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re postgraduate research student or researcher, UKRI (the organisation that contains the Research Councils) have published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ukri.org/files/termsconditions/rcukukriterms/transgender-employees-in-the-work-place-pdf/&quot;&gt;guidance on how transgender researchers should be supported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are active local student trans organisations like the ones at &lt;a href=&quot;http://trans.durhamlgbta.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Durham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/HudSUTrans&quot;&gt;Huddersfield&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/UoMtrans&quot;&gt;University of Manchester&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:4000/assets/images/activism.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Covers of two publications about trans activism&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, students interested in activism might want to check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://actionfortranshealth.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ATH-Student-Activist-Guide-3.pdf&quot;&gt;Action for Trans Health Student Activism Guide&lt;/a&gt; - and to keep safe, remember to read the important booklet from Green and Black Cross about &lt;a href=&quot;https://greenandblackcross.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Being-Trans-and-Protesting-Protest-Key-Information.pdf&quot;&gt;how to keep yourself as safe as possible when protesting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK is home to a huge variety of creative people with a huge variety of gender identities and histories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we introduce some of the UK YouTubers you might not have heard of who identify as trans, nonbinary, genderqueer, or otherwise gender non-conforming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;not-just-the-obvious-names&quot;&gt;Not just the obvious names&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has produced some genuinely famous trans and nonbinary YouTubers with hundreds of thousands of subscribers, most notably &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/TheRealJazzBertie&quot;&gt;Alex Bertie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/JakeFTMagic&quot;&gt;Jake Edwards&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/MrPinocchio17&quot;&gt;Jamie Raines&lt;/a&gt;, who have racked up over 30 million views between them to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we’ve got a huge range of other talent you might not have heard of.&lt;/p&gt;

Finally, we couldn’t go without mentioning the My Genderation project and members nonbinary campaigners and filmmakers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/tigersnack&quot;&gt;Fox and Owl&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;feeling-inspiration&quot;&gt;Feeling inspiration?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these amazing talented people have inspired you to make changes to gender-related things in your own life, our website &lt;a href=&quot;http://genderkit.org.uk&quot;&gt;Gender Construction Kit&lt;/a&gt; could be exactly what you’re looking for. We believe people should be able to change things linked to gender - anything they need, to any mix they want, for as long as they like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:4000/assets/images/categories.png&quot; alt=&quot;Partial screenshot of the Gender Construction Kit homepage&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://genderkit.org.uk&quot;&gt;Go take a look&lt;/a&gt;! Our site is UK-focused, gives information about how to do things as safely as possible, and links to over 300 free PDFs published by UK organisations for you to download.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A major update for summer 2018</title><link href="http://0.0.0.0:4000/2018/07/06/a-major-update-for-summer-2018.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A major update for summer 2018" /><published>2018-07-06T01:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-07-06T01:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://0.0.0.0:4000/2018/07/06/a-major-update-for-summer-2018</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://0.0.0.0:4000/2018/07/06/a-major-update-for-summer-2018.html">&lt;p&gt;We’re coming up to nearly a year of Gender Construction Kit and we’re introducing some new sections - and some changes that should help people find what they’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;information-for-professionals-and-organisations&quot;&gt;Information for professionals and organisations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:4000/assets/images/supporting-grid.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of a new homepage section&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A brand new section on the homepage is also new direction for us - information for professionals and organisations who support trans, nonbinary, and otherwise gender non-conforming people. We’ve noticed over the last year that we all often need to be experts in how other people should be treating us in order to get the help we need - so this should also be a really useful tool for allowing people to self-advocate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these sections are more complete than others - in particular, we look forward to adding more to the Faith and Religion section in future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-new-help-and-advicesection&quot;&gt;A new help and advice section&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:4000/assets/images/help-section-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of a new homepage section&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a huge amount of information on Gender Construction Kit providing help and advice already, but it was difficult to find the information you needed. We think this new approach is a much better way of helping people find what they need - combining useful organisations, books, web links, and PDFs in articles related to a specific topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;our-archive-of-uk-documents&quot;&gt;Our archive of UK documents&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of this update we’ve collected many, many more PDFs from all sorts of UK organisations, and we’re now tracking more than 300 in &lt;a href=&quot;http://genderkit.org.uk/publications&quot;&gt;our index&lt;/a&gt;. This is nearly double the number from a few months ago, and we’re aware this is probably now the largest public archive of gender diversity material in the UK. We’re taking care to ensure that all these publications are being backed up - who knows, in future maybe these will be part of a historical record of the changes taking place in the UK in the 2010s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;open-source&quot;&gt;Open source&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally: Gender Construction Kit is an &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/genderkit/genderkit&quot;&gt;open source project&lt;/a&gt;, and we welcome contributions - whether it is proofreading, fact checking, article submissions, illustrations, or to the code that runs the website. If you want to join in, come check out the project page on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of running the site, we maintain open source data sets listing UK gender organisations, publications, and books, with tags describing useful categories for the data. You’re free to reuse these in your own projects - send us a message on Twitter or Facebook if you’d like to know more.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">We’re coming up to nearly a year of Gender Construction Kit and we’re introducing some new sections - and some changes that should help people find what they’re looking for.</summary></entry></feed>
