It can be overwhelming trying to learn everything you need to know about gender diversity - whether that means trans, nonbinary, or otherwise gender non-conforming people, or just people who are questioning who they are.
 
Your time is valuable - so here's a quick summary of the most important guidance out there.

### If you read nothing else...

...take a look at the General Medical Council's [site on trans healthcare]() - or get started by watching the video introduction.

### National guidelines

Each nation's public health body has published a policy for how patients should be treated.

- **NHS England**: [Gender Dysphoria Protocol](https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/int-gend-proto.pdf). NHS England have also published information for GPs on [prescribing and monitoring hormones](http://www.dorsetccg.nhs.uk/Downloads/aboutus/medicines-management/Other%20Guidelines/Specialised%20services%20circular.pdf) and information for GPs on handling [requests from private medical service providers](https://gendergp.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GMC-advice-to-GPs-on-online-specialists.pdf).
- **NHS Scotland**: [Gender Reassignment Protocol](http://www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/mels/CEL2012_26.pdf). You should also read [Interim Guidance](http://www.ngicns.scot.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Gender-Reassignment-Interim-Guidance-2.pdf) which contains updates to the protocol. Some [explanatory notes](http://www.ngicns.scot.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/NGICNS-Explanatory-Notes-for-GRP-v1-0-2.pdf) have been published which may help you.
- **NHS Wales**: [Specialised Services Policy CP21](http://www.whssc.wales.nhs.uk/sitesplus/documents/1119/CP21%20Gender%20Services%20Specialies%20Services%20Policy%20%20Approved%201209251.pdf)

Additionally, the specialist gender services follow the [Royal College of Psychiatrists Good Practice Guidelines for the Assessment and Treatment of Adults with Gender Dysphoria](http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/files/pdfversion/CR181_Nov15.pdf).

All guidelines suggest you should refer patients to specialist gender services, and you can find a [full list of these on our website](https://genderkit.org.uk/resources/gender-services/).

### Local information

On top of this, many CCGs and NHS Trusts have written guidance for their staff on how patients - and often staff - should be treated. The full list of policies are listed on [our Information for Clinicians page](https://genderkit.org.uk/resources/clinicians/).

### Information for nurses

The Royal College of Nursing have produced [guidance on fair care for trans patients](https://www.rcn.org.uk/-/media/royal-college-of-nursing/documents/publications/2017/march/pub-005844.pdf) and there is also a [toolkit for nurses on preventing suicide among trans young people](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/417707/Trans_suicide_Prevention_Toolkit_Final_26032015.pdf).

### Want to learn more?

Our [Information for Clinicians](https://genderkit.org.uk/resources/clinicians/) page has an up-to-date list of information you can download from UK health organisations like RCGP, NHS Wales, and FSRH, along with links to the BMJ Best Practice guidelines on this subject.

If you're looking to update your knowledge, why not take a look at one of these brand new books aimed at practitioners?

[Transgender Health](https://www.jkp.com/uk/transgender-health-1.html) is a guide to how to provide excellent primary care to gender diverse patients, with practical advice not just on clinical procedures, but also how to emphasise with and talk to this group.

[The Transgender Handbook](https://www.novapublishers.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=61666) - edited by senior staff from one of the UK's largest gender clinics, and with contributions for expert clinicians from across the UK and European gender services - gives the most up-to-date overview of care for transgender people.

Finally, if you're working with a gender diverse patient, our website [Gender Construction Kit](https://genderkit.org.uk) could be exactly what they are looking for. We believe people should be able to change things linked to gender - anything they need, to any mix they want, for as long as they like.
