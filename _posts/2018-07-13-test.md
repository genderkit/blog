The UK is home to a huge variety of creative people with a huge variety of gender identities and histories. 

In this article, we introduce some of the UK YouTubers you might not have heard of who identify as trans, nonbinary, genderqueer, or otherwise gender non-conforming.

### Not just the obvious names

The UK has produced some genuinely famous trans and nonbinary YouTubers with hundreds of thousands of subscribers, most notably [Alex Bertie](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheRealJazzBertie), [Jake Edwards](https://www.youtube.com/user/JakeFTMagic), and [Jamie Raines](https://www.youtube.com/user/MrPinocchio17), who have racked up over 30 million views between them to date.

But we've got a huge range of other talent you might not have heard of.
