We're coming up to nearly a year of Gender Construction Kit and we're introducing some new sections - and some changes that should help people find what they're looking for.

### Information for professionals and organisations

A brand new section on the homepage is also new direction for us - information for professionals and organisations who support trans, nonbinary, and otherwise gender non-conforming people. We've noticed over the last year that we all often need to be experts in how other people should be treating us in order to get the help we need - so this should also be a really useful tool for allowing people to self-advocate.

Some of these sections are more complete than others - in particular, we look forward to adding more to the Faith and Religion section in future.

### A new help and adviceÂ section

We had a huge amount of information on Gender Construction Kit providing help and advice already, but it was difficult to find the information you needed. We think this new approach is a much better way of helping people find what they need - combining useful organisations, books, web links, and PDFs in articles related to a specific topic.

### Our archive of UK documents

As part of this update we've collected many, many more PDFs from all sorts of UK organisations, and we're now tracking more than 300 in [our index](http://genderkit.org.uk/publications). This is nearly double the number from a few months ago, and we're aware this is probably now the largest public archive of gender diversity material in the UK. We're taking care to ensure that all these publications are being backed up - who knows, in future maybe these will be part of a historical record of the changes taking place in the UK in the 2010s.

### Open source

Finally: Gender Construction Kit is an [open source project](http://github.com/genderkit/genderkit), and we welcome contributions - whether it is proofreading, fact checking, article submissions, illustrations, or to the code that runs the website. If you want to join in, come check out the project page on GitHub.

As part of running the site, we maintain open source data sets listing UK gender organisations, publications, and books, with tags describing useful categories for the data. You're free to reuse these in your own projects - send us a message on Twitter or Facebook if you'd like to know more.
