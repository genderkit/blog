It's 2018 and it's impossible to avoid supporting trans, nonbinary, and other non-conforming students - we are everywhere!

You might not be aware of it yet, but in the last few years, UK universities have been hard at work producing policies and guidance on how to best support their students - whatever their gender identity or history.

Read on to find out what your university has to say.

Let us know if there is a policy you know about that's not on the list!

### Unis aren't the only people involved

Of course, it's not just universities who are the only people who have a responsibility for their gender diverse student and staff bodies.

![UKRI and Research Council logos]({{ "/assets/images/UKRI and nine council logos.PNG" | absolute_url | replace: '0.0.0.0', '127.0.0.1' }})

If you're postgraduate research student or researcher, UKRI (the organisation that contains the Research Councils) have published [guidance on how transgender researchers should be supported](https://www.ukri.org/files/termsconditions/rcukukriterms/transgender-employees-in-the-work-place-pdf/).

![NUS Trans Campaign logo]({{ "/assets/images/nus-trans.jpg" | absolute_url | replace: '0.0.0.0', '127.0.0.1' }})

The NUS also have a dedicated [NUS Trans Campaign](http://www.twitter.com/nus_trans) that represents trans students. There are also active local student trans organisations like the ones at [Durham](http://trans.durhamlgbta.org.uk/), [Huddersfield](http://www.twitter.com/HudSUTrans), and [University of Manchester](http://www.twitter.com/UoMtrans).

![Covers of two publications about trans activism]({{ "/assets/images/activism.jpg" | absolute_url | replace: '0.0.0.0', '127.0.0.1' }})

Finally, students interested in activism might want to check out the [Action for Trans Health Student Activism Guide](http://actionfortranshealth.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ATH-Student-Activist-Guide-3.pdf) - and to keep safe, remember to read the important booklet from Green and Black Cross about [how to keep yourself as safe as possible when protesting](https://greenandblackcross.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Being-Trans-and-Protesting-Protest-Key-Information.pdf).
