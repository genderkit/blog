### If you read nothing else

Before starting a research project, please read [Vincent (2018)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19419899.2018.1434558) which provides guidelines for ethical research with gender diverse populations.

### 

Some starting points!

- Lead with how genderkit can help for people who are skimming

In the last few years, universities have hosted research projects specifically studying UK trans people, like [the Trans Aging project](http://trans-ageing.swan.ac.uk/) at Swansea University and [the TransEDU Scotland project](https://www.trans.ac.uk/Research/tabid/6347/Default.aspx) at University of Strathclyde.

Other research is done by charities (some LGBT specific, some not), govermental bodies, and occasionally companies. Later in this post, there's a big list of nearly 50 UK-focused studies done by these bodies. 

### Important academic journals

The [International Journal of Transgenderism](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/wijt20/current) is edited by the UK's own Walter Pierre Bouman from the National Centre for Transgender Health in Nottingham, and has featured many UK authors.

[Transgender Health](https://home.liebertpub.com/publications/transgender-health/634/overview) focuses on healthcare issues. Transgender Health is **open-access**, meaning that all papers are available for all to read without payment.

[Transgender Studies Quarterly](https://www.dukeupress.edu/tsq-transgender-studies-quarterly) takes a wider interdisciplinary view less focused on medical issues.

### Books
- [Genderqueer and Non-Binary Genders](https://www.palgrave.com/gb/book/9781137510525) has contributions from a wide range of UK authors across many fields.
- [Understanding trans health](http://policy.bristoluniversitypress.co.uk/understanding-trans-health) by Ruth Pearce
- [Transgender Health](https://www.jkp.com/uk/transgender-health-1.html) by Ben Vincent.
- [The Transgender Handbook](https://www.novapublishers.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=61666)
- [History of trans rights in the UK](https://unbound.com/books/trans-britain/)

### UK networking opportunities

![Trans Studies Network logo]({{ "/assets/images/TSN.jpg" | absolute_url | replace: '0.0.0.0', '127.0.0.1' }})

The [Trans Studies Network UK](https://transstudiesuk.wordpress.com/) run a mailing list - email transstudiesuk@gmail.com if you want to be added.

There is also the [TRANS-ACADEMIC](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=TRANS-ACADEMIC) mailing list.

The [Annual Brighton Trans and Non Binary Conference](https://transpridebrighton.org/event/trans-non-binary-and-intersex-conference-2018/) has run for three years.
